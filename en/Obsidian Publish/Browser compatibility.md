Visitors to Publish sites may use older browsers that are not compatible with new CSS features. For this reason we recommend being conservative with advanced CSS features in the Publish context. This is in contrast to Obsidian App themes which target a narrow scope of rendering engines (recent versions of Chromium/Blink) that support newer browser features. Try searching [caniuse.com](https://caniuse.com/) to see which CSS features are broadly available across browsers.
