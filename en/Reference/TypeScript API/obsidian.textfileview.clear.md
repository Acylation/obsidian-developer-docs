## TextFileView.clear() method

Clear the editor. This is usually called when we're about to open a completely different file, so it's best to clear any editor states like undo-redo history, and any caches/indexes associated with the previous file contents.

**Signature:**

```typescript
abstract clear(): void;
```
**Returns:**

void
